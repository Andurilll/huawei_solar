<!--

You MUST include relevant logfiles to debug your issue.

For instance: if the integration does not show up in the `+ Add Integration` list, then add any relevant lines you can find in `/config/home-assistant.log` after a full restart of your Home Assistant instance.

When you don't find any relevant logs, please increase your logging level and try again. To do this, add the following lines to your `/config/configuration.yaml`:

```
logger:
  default: debug
  logs:
    custom_components.huawei_solar: debug
```
